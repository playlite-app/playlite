# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Automatic advance for the Hero carousel on the Home and Trending pages (manual navigation via the arrow buttons
  remains available at any time)

### Fixed

- Hero banner on Home repeatedly canceling in-progress cover image requests whenever the recommendation-based slide
  resolved after other sources — the "highlighted game" was being recalculated on every render instead of computed once
  with a stable, append-only slide order
- Rendered more/fewer hooks violation on the Trending page caused by hooks being called after conditional early `return`
  statements; all hooks now run unconditionally before any early return
- Toggling a favorite in the Library or Favorites pages re-rendering every card in the grid instead of just the one
  affected, caused by the full games array being listed as a dependency of an unrelated playlist callback

### Improved

- Library and Favorites pages now render through a virtualized grid (`react-window` v2), mounting only the cards
  currently visible on screen instead of all of them at once — removes the 300+ms render commits seen on larger
  libraries and keeps performance flat as more platform integrations add more games over time
- Game card components (`StandardGameCard`, `ActionButton`, `GameActionsMenu`, `CachedImage`) memoized with
  `React.memo`, with callbacks stabilized end-to-end across `GameLibraryContext`, `UIContext`, and every page that
  renders game cards
- Duplicated card markup and logic between Library and Favorites consolidated into a shared `LibraryGameCard` component
- `CachedImage` no longer reads `localStorage` on every render (moved to a one-time lazy initializer) and skips its
  async local-cache resolution cycle entirely when the "save covers locally" setting is off

## [4.1.2] - 2026-07-07

### Improved

- Platforms configuration window internals fully refactored: the monolithic `useStoresConfig` hook was split into
  one dedicated hook per platform (Steam, Epic, Heroic, Ubisoft, Legacy Games), now living under `hooks/plataforms/`
  and only loading/persisting state relevant to that platform instead of all five at once on every tab switch
- Shared UI building blocks extracted for the platform settings screens (headers, detected-paths boxes, import
  progress indicators, action buttons/footers, path pickers), reducing duplicated markup across Steam, Epic,
  Heroic, Ubisoft, Legacy Games, and Wine tabs
- External links and auto-detected file/config paths for each platform moved into dedicated constants files
  instead of being hardcoded inline in the components
- Credential inputs on the Steam tab are now disabled while previously saved credentials are loading, preventing
  a rare race condition where in-progress typing could be overwritten once the stored credentials arrived
- Accessible labels (`aria-label`) added to path and credential inputs across all platform settings screens for
  screen reader support

## [4.1.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- GameBrain similar-games response failing to parse when a game's rating was `null`, causing the "Similar to My Profile"
  section to silently return empty results for affected anchor games
- Missing `becauseOf` field in profile-similar recommendations due to incomplete camelCase serialization, resulting in
  an empty badge/tooltip on similar game cards

## [4.1.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Ko-fi donation button in the app header, always visible for quick access
- "Support Playlite" section in Settings → About, with Ko-fi donation link and alternative ways to support
  (GitHub Sponsors, official website, bug reports)
- Official landing page link in the Quick Settings documentation section
- Custom Ko-fi icon component added to the icons library, consistent with the existing icons

### Improved

- Steam settings help callout redesigned to match the visual language of other info/warning callouts in the
  app (icon + colored title + tinted border box), replacing the previous detached Badge component
- Frontend type definitions standardized to camelCase across four modules (scanner, PCGW, GameBrain,
  subscriptions), with corresponding `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` added to the matching Rust structs —
  internal Rust field names unchanged

## [4.0.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Game search by characteristics in Wishlist using the GameBrain API
- Media tab in game details window with screenshots, trailers, and videos
- Similar games tab in game details window
- Technical details tab in game details window with system requirements, language support, and controller
  compatibility (data sourced from PCGamingWiki)

### Improved

- Game details window restructured into tabbed navigation for better content organization
- PCGamingWiki integration expanded to surface technical data directly in the UI

## [3.4.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Full internationalization (i18n) support using i18next and react-i18next
- Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) and English (en) language support
- Automatic language detection based on operating system locale
- Language selector in Settings → About section
- User language preference persisted across sessions via localStorage
- 11 translation namespaces covering all UI strings: common, settings, library, playlist, trending, wishlist, errors,
  dialog, updater, game_detail, plataforms
- 630 translation keys mapped across all views, components, dialogs, and windows
- Translation documentation and guidelines for users and contributors

### Improved

- Steam review labels now fully translated via i18n instead of hardcoded map
- Error messages in non-React modules migrated to i18n instance
- Confirmation dialog fallback strings internationalized
- Architecture ready for additional languages — only locale JSON files required

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Local Directory Scanner**: New feature that allows monitoring PC folders to automatically add games
  to the Playlite library.
- **Steam Installation Detection**: The Steam importer now identifies which games are already installed on the system,
  marking them correctly in the interface.
- **New UI Structure**: Complete refactoring of interface components, including a new Dialog system and
  lighter, more responsive Tooltips.

### Changed

- **Backend Refactoring (Rust)**: Restructuring of integrations in the Rust core for greater stability and
  performance in IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
- **Asset Optimization**: Improved loading of cover art from the GamerPower API, fixing display failures on
  unstable connections.
- **Import Flow**: The Steam sync process is now more resilient, skipping corrupted entries without
  interrupting the entire task.

### Fixed

- **Cover Art Loading**: Fixed the error that prevented images from displaying correctly in the "Free Games"
  (GamerPower) tab.
- **Tooltip Positioning**: Fine-tuned tooltip coordinate calculation to prevent them from going off-screen
  on smaller resolutions.
- **Import Stability**: Resolved a bug where the local scanner could enter an infinite loop in folders
  containing symbolic links (symlinks).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Hybrid Recommendation System (v4.0)**: The algorithm now cross-references your local profile (Content-Based)
  with data obtained from Steam users (Collaborative Filtering) to suggest games.
- **Transparency (XAI)**: Added *Smart Tooltips* on recommendations that explain the reason for the suggestion
  (e.g. "Favorite Series", "Community Trend", "High Tag Affinity").
- **Feedback Loop**: "Not Useful" (Dislike) button on recommendations, allowing the user to train the algorithm
  by ignoring specific games.
- **Automatic Update System**: Full integration with Tauri Updater. The app now checks, downloads and installs
  updates, creating **Automatic Backups** of the database before critical changes (Major Updates).
- **Resilient Offline Mode**: The "Trending", "Upcoming" and "Free Games" pages now work without internet,
  using a smart cache ("Stale-while-revalidate") and displaying an informational banner.
- **Algorithm Settings**: New section in Settings allowing adjustment of weights (Profile vs Community),
  time penalty (Nostalgia) and series prioritization.
- **Hybrid Image Cache**: Option to save cover art locally for offline viewing or save space by using
  only remote URLs.
- **Giveaways**: GamerPower integration for discovering free games.
- **AI Auto-Translation**: Game description translation using the Gemini API.

### Changed

- **GameDetailModal Refactoring**: Component restructured into smaller files, with performance and UX improvements.
- **Hooks Refactoring**: `useTrending`, `useUpcoming` and `useGiveaways` rewritten to handle network failures and
  transparently serve data from the local cache (`api_cache`).
- **metadata.rs Refactoring**: File split into smaller modules, with improvements in error handling
  and detailed logging.
- **Advanced Wishlist**: The Wishlist now has the option to import lists from Steam and IsThereAnyDeal, in addition
  to monitoring prices and discount coupons.
- **Database Architecture**: Introduction of the `app_config` table for generic system settings (Installation Date,
  Schema Version).
- **Settings Interface**: Replaced standard checkboxes with the visual `ToggleSwitch` component for better UX.
- **Cache Handling**: Optimized differentiated TTL (Time-To-Live) for lists (24h) vs game details (30 days).

### Fixed

- Fixed persistence of settings where certain algorithm weights were not being saved correctly.
- Resolved issue where the "Trending" page showed a fatal error screen upon losing connection; it now degrades
  gracefully to the cache.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **SQLite Database**: Complete migration of storage to SQLite (`library.db` and `secrets.db`), enabling
  complex relationships between games and details.
- **Recommendation System v2 (Rust)**: New native backend algorithm that calculates affinity based on genre, tags
  and series, applying a time penalty (Age Decay) for games that haven't been played in a long time.
- **IsThereAnyDeal Integration**: The Wishlist now fetches prices from multiple stores, historical lowest price,
  and automatically identifies **Discount Coupons**.
- **HLTB Backend Support**: Implementation of the search service for *HowLongToBeat* in the backend
  (preparation for future UI).
- **Voucher Column**: Added visual support to display coupon codes directly on game cards in the Wishlist.

### Changed

- **Agnostic Architecture**: The system no longer relies exclusively on Steam for metadata, prioritizing the
  RAWG API for cover art and descriptions.
- **Hooks Refactoring**: `useRecommendation` and `useHome` rewritten to consume data processed by Rust,
  removing heavy calculations from JavaScript.
- **Backup System**: Updated to include the new `wishlist` and `game_details` tables in JSON export/import.
- **Detailed Logs**: Improved tracing logs for database operations and HTTP requests.

### Removed

- **Legacy v1 Logic**: Removed old affinity calculation functions from the frontend.
- **Deprecated Fields**: Cleanup of unused fields in configuration interfaces.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- **ConfirmProvider**: Global system of custom confirmation dialogs (replacing the native `window.confirm`).
- Complete Backend (Rust) documentation, generatable via `cargo doc`.
- Visual feedback toasts for all delete and edit operations.
- JSDocs on the main reusable Hooks and Components.

### Changed

- Complete refactoring of the types folder structure (`src/types/`), now split by domain.
- Modernization of the Rust module structure (Rust 2018+ standard).
- Visual standardization of action buttons (Play, Favorite, Menu) using the new `ActionButton` component.
- Responsiveness adjustments in the Details Modal for windows with reduced height.

### Fixed

- "Race Condition" bug on deletion: The delete action was occurring before the user's confirmation. Fixed with
  proper implementation of `async/await` in the confirmation flow.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- Error logging to facilitate debugging and future improvements.
- Button to manually add a game to the wishlist.

- UI improvements on the Trending page, now with a custom empty state indicating the type of error that occurred
  (connection error, API error, etc.).
- Performance improvements for Steam game metadata import, reducing load time.

### Removed

- CheapShark API integration for game prices, due to instability and prices in USD only.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-02
